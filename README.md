# GPLime/liblime - Library Lite Input Method Engine
I have wrote this library in 2012, learning NLP at that time.
Reading source code of sunpinyin and Apache lucene,
expecting build a simplest and protable Seg split library.

- @ref sunpinyin
- @ref lucene
- @ref rime
- @ref unspim

## Feature
1. Opensource and GPL license.
2. Small and written in ANSI C.


## TODO
1. Learning Tensorflow
2. Using Tensorflow tranning lexcial and parser model.
3. Optimize word dicts.
